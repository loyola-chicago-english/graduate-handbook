## Committees

### Committee on Graduate Programs

The Director of Graduate Programs is advised on all matters of policy, admissions, and student status by the Committee on Graduate Programs.
One student, chosen by election, sits on the Committee.
The faculty members of the Committee also serve as jury for the Clayes Award (see [Awards], below).

### English Graduate Student Association

The English Graduate Student Association (EGSA) is made up of all graduate students in the Department.
A board (normally comprising five members) is elected from among the students as positions become available.
EGSA sponsors social events for students and faculty, and publishes an occasional newsletter with information about the Department, student achievements, and upcoming events.

In addition, EGSA organizes workshops on topics of interest to English graduate students at Loyola.
Recent topics have included writing for publication, the academic job search, Ph.D. exam preparation, and careers in community college teaching.
EGSA also serves as a forum for any special concerns graduate students may have and conveys those concerns to the Committee on Graduate Programs through the student representative.

Students in all phases of their graduate careers are warmly encouraged to participate actively in EGSA.
Current board membership and additional information is posted on the [EGSA webpage](https://www.luc.edu/english/graduate/resourcesandpolicies/englishgraduatestudentassociation/).
A representative for the M.A. students will be elected fall semester.

## University and Department Resources

### Student ID Cards

Student ID cards, giving access to library borrowing and other privileges, are available from the Campus Card Office, Sullivan Center, Room 198.

### Computer Services

The University maintains several Computer Centers which are available for your use in Sullivan Center, Information Commons, and at 25 E. Pearson.
There are also personal computers available for the use of Graduate Assistants in the Fishbowl (Graduate Student office space in Crown Center 418).

### The Fishbowl

All graduate students in English have access to a common space in Crown Center 418, better known as the *Fishbowl*. This is your space for studying, meetings, lunch, and socializing; however, the department is responsible for its security.
You may use the room up to the start of evening classes (7 p.m.).
After that, you must vacate the room and lock the door.

## Communications

### Email

An account on the student email system is created automatically for each new student.
Both the Director of Graduate Programs and the Graduate School will use this account to communicate with you.

It is crucial that you check your Loyola e-mail on a regular basis, or have your e-mail forwarded to an account you check regularly.
If you find that you are not receiving regular and frequent communiqués from the Department, please notify the Graduate Program Assistant.

### Mail

Each graduate student in the English Department is assigned a mailbox in the Department workroom in Crown Center.
Memos from faculty, EGSA, and University agencies are likely to be relayed to you through this mail system; therefore, these mailboxes should be checked frequently.
Since the boxes are not locked, please be careful about what you leave in your box.

If your home address, email address, or phone number change, inform the Administrative Assistant to the Graduate Program and update your records through [LOCUS].

### Bulletin Boards and Information

The bulletin board outside the GPD office (Crown 423) features information regarding the graduate programs---e.g., calls for papers, job offerings, fellowship opportunities.
The board in the English main office has departmental notices.

## Teaching and Service

### Teaching Opportunities

In addition to teaching assignments for Graduate Assistants in the Ph.D. program (see [Graduate Assistantships]), a number of teaching opportunities are available to experienced graduate students.
The University requires that instructors of undergraduate courses have the M.A. degree; the Department requires that you have taken English 402 or its equivalent.
All Ph.D. students who do not already have teaching experience are strongly encouraged to take English 402 and teach at least one writing course at Loyola.

The Department Chair, in consultation with the Director of Graduate Programs, assigns all classes.
Funded students will be assigned classes routinely; unfunded students should apply directly to the department chair.
The chairperson will invite applications for a limited number of summer teaching opportunities.
The criteria used to assign summer classes to graduate students include: experience and proven success in the classroom; good progress toward the degree; preparedness to teach the courses available; and previous summer teaching (in an effort to distribute summer courses fairly).
Contact the Department Chair or Ms. Jervier for further information.

### Service Opportunities

Students should take advantage of departmental and University service opportunities to build their resumes/curricula vitae and to gain experience in the day-to-day operations of an academic institution.
Opportunities available include but are not limited to the following: EGSA representative, Writing Programs committee, Graduate Programs committee, Undergraduate Program committee, department meeting representative, GSAC representative, Literacy Center tutor or staff person.
Calls for volunteers for these positions go out annually in the fall term.

## Summer Sessions

Two six-week summer sessions are offered through the Department each year, running from May to August.
At least two graduate-level courses are offered over the two summer terms.
When enrollment permits, we offer four courses.

## Housing and Transportation

### Housing

Most graduate students find off-campus apartments using the ads in publicly available sources.
Residence Life provides a list of [suggested resources for locating housing](https://www.luc.edu/reslife/futureresidents/graduatestudents/).

### Transportation

If you plan to commute to Loyola, there are several parking lots that you may use.
The main parking structure, adjacent to Sheridan Road and to the Halas Sports Center, houses the Parking Office, where you may purchase a sticker for annual parking.
The fee for one-day parking on campus is \$7.00.
At peak class times, available parking can sometimes be scarce.
Street parking in the community immediately surrounding campus is scarce.
It is also restricted to residents during certain hours, so be sure to read the signs carefully to avoid being ticketed by the police.

Parking is also available near the Water Tower Campus, although it is more expensive.
You can have your parking stub stamped at the information desk at the 25 E. Pearson building to receive a modest discount.
If you teach or take classes at the Water Tower Campus, you will probably want to acquaint yourself with the University's inter-campus shuttle bus service.
Public buses and the "El" run frequently between campuses and to other points in the city.

## Professional Development

### Research and Writing

Be deliberate about your choice of tools and methods for academic research and writing.
Cultivate a sense of curiosity regarding the technical details of your own scholarly practice (search and discovery, reference management, file management, reading, annotation, note-taking, drafting, revision, fact-checking, proofreading, etc.) and ask your peers and professors about their ways of working.
Do not assume that the particular set of tools and practices which you learned as an undergraduate, or earlier, will suffice for your present and future endeavors.

### Publication

Ph.D. students are encouraged to pursue the publication of one or more journal articles during their graduate careers, generally after the first couple of years in the program.
In the current job market, publication is an important means of demonstrating to prospective employers a high level of motivation and professional competence.

Three ways to prepare for this goal are 1) to read journals in your fields of interest regularly in order to become familiar with both current scholarship and the requirements of scholarly publication; 2) to review the [MLA Directory of Periodicals](https://www.mla.org/Publications/MLA-International-Bibliography/About-the-MLA-International-Bibliography/MLA-Directory-of-Periodicals) in order to learn what different journals expect or demand; and 3) to approach seminar papers, especially those in your field(s) of interest, as potential publications, possibly even as publications targeted to a particular journal.
In developing a paper for publication, students are of course well advised to work closely with their seminar instructors or faculty mentors.

### Conference Presentations and Travel Funding

Presentation of conference papers is an important part of students' professional development, and Ph.D. students in particular should aim to give at least two papers during their graduate careers---preferably including professional and not just graduate-student conferences.

Each semester the Graduate School has funds to support graduate student travel for the purpose of presenting papers or chairing sessions at conferences.
Funds are limited, so students should apply promptly upon acceptance of their papers or sessions.
Information is available from the Graduate School's page on [Graduate Research](https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/currentstudents/graduateresearch/).

The Department also has funding for attending summer seminars or conducting dissertation research at a research library outside Chicago.
These are competitive awards offered each semester.

The current subvention from the Graduate School for travel is a maximum of \$750.
Departmental travel support, which is funded primarily from the EGSA Student Activities budget, is likely to provide a much lower level of sponsorship.

After you return from supported travel, you will be asked to supply all original receipts as well as boarding passes for your trip, and proof of attendance (conference registration receipt and program copy with your session).
Ask the Graduate Program Assistant for the travel expense form, fill it out, and return it with the receipts to the Graduate School (for their funding) or to the Director of Graduate Programs (for EGSA funding).

### Placement Officer

Each year a member of the faculty is appointed to advise students in their process of finding employment post-graduation.
The Placement Officer offers advice on all aspects of the job search and will arrange for mock interviews.
All students who are entering the job market should contact the Placement Officer in the semester before they begin to apply for positions.

The department has two collections of advice and information for students entering the job market:

- [The Academic Job Search](https://www.luc.edu/english/graduate/resourcesandpolicies/theacademicjobsearch/)
- [A Sakai site](https://sakai.luc.edu/portal/site/cbbe1aa5-2045-4182-ac93-c26499a0fa0a)

Contact the placement officer for access to the Sakai site.

### Career Center

Each student entering the job market should establish a dossier containing letters of recommendation.
This dossier is maintained by the university's Career Center, located in Sullivan Center, Room 255 (phone: 773-508-7716).
See the [Career Services website](https://www.luc.edu/career/index.shtml).

## Awards

### Clayes Essay Awards

Each year the Department sponsors a competition among graduate students for the Stanley Clayes Memorial Award.
Cash prizes are awarded to essays written for 400-level graduate seminars in the preceding academic year.
The call for papers comes out at the beginning of fall term.
For details see the [Stanley Clayes Essay Competition Submission Guidelines].

### Gravett-Tuma Book Award

Twice a year two students are selected to receive the Gravett-Tuma Book Award, made possible by a generous donation from alumna Amber Gravett and her husband.
In the fall, students eligible for this award are those who have taken ENGL 502 (Independent Study for Doctoral Qualification) the previous year; in the spring those eligible are students entering their fourth semester in our program.

# Regulations and Procedures

## Advising

The Director of Graduate Programs (abbreviated GPD) serves as faculty advisor for all M.A. students and for Ph.D. students prior to [Advancement to Candidacy].
Students meet individually with the GPD prior to [Registration] each semester.
Students are encouraged to meet with the GPD at other times and must do so when plans change (for instance, when contemplating [Withdrawal] from a course, [Leaves of Absence], or an [Incomplete]).

Ph.D. students applying for faculty jobs are advised by the [Placement Officer].

## Course Loads

A full-time student will usually carry three courses per semester, or, for Graduate Assistants entering the classroom as instructors, two courses and one teaching assignment.
Course loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual basis.
All students funded by the Department or the Graduate School are considered full time.

## Registration

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing their dissertations.
A schedule of courses for the upcoming term is available a few months before classes are scheduled to begin.

To register for graduate courses you must first consult with the Director of Graduate Programs.
Once your selections are approved, they will be entered into the system by the Administrative Assistant to the program, completing the registration process.
Graduate students do *not* register for courses themselves, but you must check [LOCUS] to verify your registration each semester.

Students must maintain continual registration throughout their years in the program or risk having to apply for reinstatement and pay both a penalty and back fees.

## Grades

The grading system used in the Graduate School is as follows.
Letter grades:

--- -----
A    4.00
A-   3.67
B+   3.33
B    3.00
B-   2.67
C+   2.33
C    2.00
D    1.00
F    0.00
--- -----

Other grades:

--- ---------------------
I   Incomplete
W   Withdrawal
WF  Withdrawal, Failure
CR  Credit
NC  No Credit
AU  Audit
--- ---------------------

For further information on Loyola's grading policy, consult the [Graduate School Catalog](https://catalog.luc.edu/graduate-professional/).

Graduate students in the English Department are expected to maintain an average of not less than *B* (3.0).
Those who fail to meet this requirement may be dismissed.
No more than two grades below *B* and no grades of *D* or *F* may be counted as fulfilling degree requirements.
In any case, Ph.D. students who find themselves receiving primarily *B*'s (or below) should consider seriously whether pursuing a doctorate in English remains the most gainful use of their time.

## Withdrawal

Withdrawal from graduate seminars is uncommon; students must consult with the Graduate Program Director before dropping through [LOCUS].
Students should check the academic calendar for deadlines on withdrawing for full or partial refunds, and with a W or F grade.
Students are responsible for withdrawing themselves from classes.

## Incompletes

Faculty may assign the grade of *I* to a student who has not completed the assigned work by the end of the term.
This grade is not assigned automatically; rather, it is up to the student to work out with the instructor a plan, including a deadline, for completing the work for the course.
Incompletes require the approval of the Graduate Program Director.
Students need to download the change-of-grade form from the Graduate School website and give it to the Graduate Program Director when the incomplete is approved.

The student must complete and submit all outstanding work to the instructor by the last day of the semester following the term in which the I grade was assigned.
If the student does not turn in the work by the deadline, the *I* will automatically become an *F*.
Students contemplating an incomplete should read the policy on the [Graduate School webpage](http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml).

Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional incomplete, it is of course better *not* to take an incomplete when possible.
Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect, particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course.
In any case, faculty members have various policies regarding incompletes, so it is advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible if you anticipate the need for an incomplete.
You must also complete a form (see [Department Links and Forms]) and have it signed by the GPD.

No more than one *I* can be requested in a semester, unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., a serious illness).

## Leaves of Absence

Official leaves of absence are intended for students who wish to discontinue temporarily their graduate studies due to special circumstances (e.g., medical, personal, or professional reasons).
A leave of absence postpones all deadlines concerning completion of degree requirements for the duration of the leave.
A student requesting a leave must complete a Leave of Absence form (available on [GSPS]) and contact the Graduate Program Director, who then makes a recommendation on the student's behalf to the Graduate School.
Decisions regarding the approval of leaves of absence rest with the Graduate School.
Leaves of absence may be requested for a semester or for a full academic year.

To be reinstated to active status, the student must notify the Graduate School in writing upon returning from a leave.
Unless the student is granted a renewal of a leave, he or she must return to active status in the semester following its expiration.
Failure to do so may result in withdrawal from the program.

## Advanced Standing/Transfer Credits

It is ordinarily expected that all work for the Master's degree will be completed at Loyola.
Upon the recommendation of the Director of Graduate Programs, however, and with the approval of the Dean, up to six hours of credit for graduate work at another university may be counted toward the M.A. degree.

For students entering the Ph.D. program with prior graduate work, up to thirty hours of credit may, with the Department's recommendation and the Dean's approval, be counted toward a Loyola Ph.D.
The precise number of hours credited toward advanced standing is worked out by the Director of Graduate Programs during a student's first semester in the program.

## Academic Honesty

Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests primarily as plagiarism.
The [Graduate School Catalog](https://catalog.luc.edu/academic-standards-regulations/graduate-professional/graduate-school/) defines plagiarism as "the appropriation for gain of ideas, language or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material is not one's own."
As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not.
If you are ever uncertain, it is of course best to consult the Director of Graduate Programs or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the assignment, which may well be tantamount to failure in the course.
A serious breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola.
Although extremely rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have resulted in dismissal.

## Grievance Procedure

Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any problems they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion.
If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty, or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet with the Director of Graduate Programs to discuss the matter.
If the problem cannot be satisfactorily resolved by the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair who, if necessary, will refer it to a departmental grievance committee.
The decision of that committee can be appealed to the Graduate School.
Students wishing to initiate a grievance must do so in writing to the Dean.
Further information can be obtained from the Graduate School office.

## Graduation and Application for Degree

Loyola confers degrees three times each year: May, August, and December.
A student graduates when they have completed all degree requirements and submitted an application for the degree.
Applications for degree are due approximately six months before degree conferral: typically December 1 for a May degree, February 1 for an August degree, and August 1 for a December degree.
These dates are set by the Graduate School: see the list of [Key Dates and Deadlines].
Applications for degree are submitted through [LOCUS].
Late applications are not accepted: students who miss a deadline must apply for a subsequent graduation date.

As students "walk" only at the May graduation, August and December degree students may walk in the May ceremony the following year.

# The Master of Arts program

## Program Requirements

Students in the M.A. program complete course requirements and a qualifying exam.

### Course Requirements

- English 400 (Introduction to Graduate Study).
- English 402 (Teaching College Composition) (required for the teaching track only)
- At least *three* courses in literary studies. At least *one* course must be in literature before 1800, *one* in literature after 1800.
- At least *one* course in critical theory (courses numbered 410--429).
- One course in textual studies or digital humanities, or (for the teaching track) pedagogy.
- Four elective courses, for a total of thirty hours.

### M.A. Qualifying Examination

All students will take a four-hour written examination at the end of their course work.
The exam is given during the last week of second summer term in August, and the first day of exam week in December and May.
The exam will be prepared and graded by a four-member M.A. examining committee using a standard set of questions, each testing a particular skill.
Faculty teaching graduate seminars in any one year will submit a short list of required readings (literary, critical, and theoretical) from their courses.
From that list, the examining committee will form a master list of major texts to be used by students in answering the exam questions.
The short lists will be shared with students prior to the exam, the master list will not.

The exam will be graded as High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fail.
The minimum requirements for the M.A. degree will be a Low Pass on the exam and a B average in all course work.
M.A. students who fail the exam may retake it once.

Ph.D. students who fail the exam may also retake it once, but only to complete the M.A. degree: they will not be allowed to continue in the program.
Ph.D. students who receive a Low Pass will have their exams forwarded to the Committee on Graduate Programs, which will review their exams and their performance in course work in order to determine whether or not they should be permitted to continue, and if so under what probationary conditions.

## Time and Residence Requirements

The M.A. is designed so that a full-time student can complete requirements in a year and a half of study --- Fall, Spring, one summer course, and the following Fall with a degree conferral in December.
Part-time students must complete all requirements for the degree within four years.
After five years, the student may continue only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.

# The Doctor of Philosophy Program

## Program Requirements

Doctoral students in English who have completed the M.A. degree enter one of three specialized fields.
Students must meet general course requirements and course requirements of their specialization, pass a Ph.D. qualifying exam, and meet other program requirements, as detailed in the following sections.

### General Course Requirements

- English 400: Introduction to Graduate Study
- English 402: Teaching College Composition
- English 502: Independent Study for Doctoral Qualification (see [English 502])
- Two courses in critical theory or textual studies; at least one of these two courses must be in critical theory

### Field-Specific Course Requirements

Medieval and Renaissance Literature:

- At least *six* courses in Medieval and Renaissance Literature (numbered 440--459)
- At least *one* course in Nineteenth-Century Studies (ENGL 460--478 and 490--493)
- At least *one* course in Modern Literature and Culture (480--489 and 494--499)
- *Seven* electives to fulfill the 60-hour requirement

Nineteenth-Century Studies:

- At least *six *courses in Nineteenth-Century Literature (numbered 470--479, 490--493)
- At least *one* courses in Medieval or Renaissance Literature (440--459)
- At least *one* course in Modern Literature and Culture (480--489 and 494--499)
- *Seven *electives to fulfill the 60-hour requirement

Modern Literature and Culture (including postmodern and contemporary literatures):

- At least *six* courses in Modern Literature (numbered 480--489 and 494--499)
- At least *one* course in Medieval or Renaissance Literature (440--459)
- At least *one* course in Nineteenth-Century Literature (470--479, 490--493)
- *Seven* electives to fulfill the 60-hour requirement

Other courses not listed above may, at the discretion of the Graduate Program Director, count toward one period requirement or another, depending on their specific content in a given semester.
Also, with approval of the Graduate Program Director, students may take a graduate course in another department for elective credit as long as the course is taught by a professor with a terminal degree (that is, a Ph.D. not an M.A.).

Students are free to change their field at any time, provided that they are able to fulfill the course requirements for the new field.

### Ph.D. Qualifying Examination

The Ph.D. examination includes a written and an oral component.
The written exam consists of three three-hour papers covering fields to be chosen by the student in consultation with his or her examining committee and the Director of Graduate Programs.
With the approval of their examiners, students must define three fields.
Fields may be of the following kinds:

1. An area of critical, cultural, or literary theory
2. An author
3. The literature of an historical period and/or genre, which may be additionally focused
4. Textual studies/digital humanities

Students may include up to three fields of the third type, but only one field of any other type.
Examples of literary fields might include:

- 17th-Century British poetry
- Early Modern women's writing
- Postcolonial drama
- Medieval drama
- African-American literature, 1914--1959
- Contemporary working-class fiction of the U.S.
- Modernist poetry
- Modernist manifestos

Any or all of the exam fields may be related to the student's dissertation topic; however, some breadth across fields is expected.
And although the selection of texts within each field will be influenced to some extent by the student's particular interests and approach, he or she will also be expected to demonstrate a general mastery of the field.

Exams are given in November, February, and April each year.
Field descriptions and reading lists are worked out by the student in consultation with his or her examining committee and must be approved by the examiners and by the Director of Graduate Programs well before the written examination is scheduled.
The Director of Graduate Programs will provide a packet of materials detailing all exam-related procedures.

Reading lists are due several months before the exam date, and field statements are due one month prior to the exam.
Students cannot schedule their exam times until the field statements have been submitted.
The written examination is followed by a two-hour oral examination that is based on, but not limited to, the written portion.
Students who fail the exam may retake it once, within one year.

### Research Tool

Ph.D.-level research in literary studies presupposes skills (or 'research tools') not taught in ordinary graduate-level coursework in a Department of English.
In view of the multilingual character of humanist study, scholars of literature must often read text in a language other than their principal one.
For these reasons, as fulfilment of the discipline's research tool, Ph.D. students in the Department of English are required to demonstrate reading proficiency in a language other than English.
Under special circumstances priority may be given to another research tool: for instance, a computer language, statistical analysis, or protocols for research with human subjects.
Students are encouraged to discuss completion of this requirement with the Director of Graduate Programs soon after entering the program.

### Responsible Conduct in Research and Scholarship

The Graduate School requires all Ph.D. students to attend one of its workshops on *Responsible Conduct in Research and Scholarship* (RCRS) prior to completing the dissertation or thesis.
Ph.D. students are encouraged to wait until their third or fourth year to fulfill this requirement.
Workshops are offered throughout the year by the Office of Research Services.
Details are posted on the [RCRS webpage](https://www.luc.edu/ors/RCRHome.shtml).

### Advancement to Candidacy

You become a Ph.D. candidate when you complete all course requirements (including [English 502]), fulfill the research tool requirement, pass the Ph.D. Examination, establish a dissertation committee, and have your dissertation proposal approved (ideally within 6 months of completing the comprehensive exams).

The selection of dissertation topic, director, and committee (two additional faculty "readers") is made in consultation with the Graduate Program Director.
Once these decisions have been made, you must obtain a copy of the Graduate School's forms regarding the dissertation (available on line), and then prepare a proposal for the approval of your committee.
After your proposal and committee are approved, you are considered ABD.
Your progress now will be monitored by your dissertation director, who will report on your work to the GPD.
(Note: You do *not* need to have the proposal approved by the entire committee to complete 502.)

### Dissertation

When your dissertation is completed, you will give a "Final Public Presentation and Defense" of your project, followed by a question-and-answer session led by your dissertation committee.
Reader's copies are due to the committee one month prior to the defense, with a reader's ballot for each member (see [Department Links and Forms]).
Once these ballots are submitted, the Graduate Programs secretary will announce the defense publicly.
At the defense, students present the chair of the committee with the Graduate School ballot for approval of the dissertation.
See the Graduate School's [list of downloadable forms](http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/servicesandresources_forms.shtml).

Students should check the Graduate School's calendar of [Key Dates and Deadlines] for deadlines on format check and submission of the dissertation (now done electronically).

## Policies on Special Courses

### English 501

English 501 ("Directed Readings") is an elective "independent study" course which may be taken at most twice in the Ph.D. program.
If you are interested in this option, you must first find a faculty member willing to direct it.
You must then fill out a departmental form (see [Department Links and Forms]) and submit the form to the Director of Graduate Programs for approval in the semester prior to the course.

Proposals for 501 courses will not be approved if the material to be covered is regularly offered in existing graduate seminars.
501 requires a minimum of 12 contact hours between faculty and student (approximately 1 hour every week) and a minimum of 25 pages of writing.

### English 502

In English 502 ("Independent Study for Doctoral Qualification") students prepare for the [Ph.D. Qualifying Examination] and write a draft their dissertation proposals, or at least a literature review, under the supervision of their eventual dissertation directors.
Graduate School and English Department forms must be approved by the Director of Graduate Programs in the semester prior to the course.

English 502 explicitly couples the drafting of a dissertation proposal---and thus the earliest stages of dissertation research, the formation of a core bibliography, and the definition of the project itself---with the student's preparation for the Ph.D. Exam.
The Department believes that these tasks are closely related, that they can and should be accomplished together, and that neither should supercede or delay the other.
502 requires a minimum of 7 contact hours between faculty and student (approximately 1 hour every two weeks) and the submission of a draft of the proposal or substantial progress toward that proposal, such as a literature review.

The draft proposal is usually completed after taking the exams, which often means that it is necessary to take a temporary *I* grade for the course.
If a student takes an Incomplete in English 502, the course must be completed the next semester after the semester of registration.
(See [Incompletes], above.)
A student who does not complete English 502 within the specified time will have to retake the course at his or her own expense.

### Registration for Advanced Students

Students who have completed their course work should register for ENGL 610.
After two semesters in ENGL 610, or once you have gained ABD status (see [Advancement to Candidacy]), you should register for ENGL 600.
Students must maintain continuous registration in English 600 until they complete their degree.
Both courses require a minimum of one contact hour monthly with the dissertation director and substantial writing (preferably a chapter draft) every 3 months.

Students do not need to register for 600 or 610 during the summer months.
However, those on government loans who must show they are registered for classes over the summer can register for a "dummy" course, either GSSM S61 (if they are in 610) or S60 (for 600).
Students must register for these courses themselves and will pay a nominal fee.

## Other Policies Governing Progress to Degree

### Portfolio Review

Because first-year Ph.D. students must register for fall classes before taking the M.A. exam, the department has instituted a portfolio review for all first-year Ph.D. students whose GPA for the fall and spring semesters is below 3.5.
Those students must submit a portfolio of three essays (totaling at least 30 pages) to the Director of Graduate Programs the week after spring semester final exams.
The portfolio must contain a letter to the GPD explaining the challenges the student faced the first year and how the student has responded to those challenges.
Members of the Graduate Programs Committee will review the portfolio and make a recommendation to the GPD.
Even if the student is advised not to continue for the Ph.D., he or she will take the M.A. exam in August to complete the M.A. degree.

### Time and Residence Requirements

According to Graduate School regulations, work on the Ph.D. must be completed eight years from the time you have begun course work applicable to the degree; if you entered with an M.A., you will have six years from the time of beginning course work for the Ph.D.

Students who are beyond the eight-year (or six-year) limit will be surveyed on their progress annually by the Graduate Program Director and must apply to the Graduate School for an extension of their time limit.
The Graduate Program Director and dissertation director will issue a recommendation to the Graduate School as to whether each such student should be permitted to continue toward the degree.
Extensions are not routine; students must demonstrate that they are making progress toward the degree.

Students requesting extensions must fill out the request form in [GSPS].
The GPD will review the request before it is sent on to the Graduate School.

## Assistantship and Fellowship Support

### Graduate Assistantships

Each year the Department of English offers a number of Graduate Assistantships for new and continuing students.
Unlike many other universities, however, Loyola concentrates on developing assistants' skills before allowing them to assume sole responsibility for a composition course.
Rather than being immediately assigned to teach a class during their first semester of graduate school, assistants first gain experience tutoring undergraduates in the Writing Center.
In the first two semesters they usually tutor for two shifts.

During their third semester, assistants work with a faculty member in a mentorship program that allows them to assume some grading and instructional duties within the mentor's composition class.
In the fourth semester, assistants teach one composition course, receiving informal support and guidance from the mentor of the previous semester.

In the third, fourth and fifth years, assistants normally work as teaching assistants in a literature course, teach one literature course per term, or serve as research assistants for one semester.
In addition, one student each year is assigned as the assistant director of the Writing Center, and fifth-year students may be asked to cover a shift in the Writing Center each term.
Graduate instructors at Loyola never teach more than one class per term.

Typically students are expected to work between 10 and 15 hours per week, but no more than 20, as stipulated by the Graduate School.

The broad terms of the assistantships and their monetary value are determined by The Graduate School.

### Policy on Graduate Student Substitutes

All third, fourth, and fifth-year graduate assistants who are not serving as instructors-of-record also take courses for faculty who must miss a class because of professional conferences, previously scheduled speaking engagements, or for other occasions as approved by the chair.
Students serving as substitutes in a given semester cannot turn down a request to take a faculty member's class unless they are in class themselves or attending a professional conference.
In turn, the department makes every effort to distribute the workload equitably among the students serving in this capacity.
Students should be called upon to cover a class no more than 5 times in the course of a semester.

Because the students are not necessarily trained in the content area of the faculty member's course, faculty members must devise assignments with this in mind.
Substitutes may show a film, conduct a writing workshop prepared by the faculty member, or proctor an exam.
Substitutes must not be asked to prepare the course themselves.

### Funding for Advanced Students

Students who have completed course work, passed the Ph.D. exam, and received approval of their dissertation proposals are eligible to apply for one of three fellowships:

- Arthur J. Schmitt Dissertation Fellowship (university-wide competition; no teaching requirement)
- Teaching Scholars Awards (university wide competition; service requirement includes the teaching of one course)
- Crown Fellowship (competitive with the other humanities departments; no teaching requirement)

For further information on these awards see the Graduate School's page on [Financial Assistance and Funding](http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/FundingGrad.Education.shtml), under "Fellowships & Scholarships."
