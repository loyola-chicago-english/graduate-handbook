## English Graduate Student Association

All graduate students are encouraged to participate in the English Graduate Student Association (EGSA).
The EGSA board (normally comprising five members) is elected from among the students as positions become available.
Current board membership and additional information is posted on the [EGSA webpage](https://www.luc.edu/english/graduate/resourcesandpolicies/englishgraduatestudentassociation/).

One member of the EGSA board serves as official liason to the faculty.
This member should be placed on the department's faculty email list and will be invited to attend certain faculty meetings and meetings of the Graduate Programs Committee.

Activities of EGSA include:

- Social events for students and faculty
- Workshops on topics of interest to English graduate students at Loyola; recent topics have included writing for publication, the academic job search, Ph.D. exam preparation, and careers in community college teaching
- Articulating interests and concerns of graduate students to the GPD and Graduate Programs Committee
- Allocation of the money received from student activity fees: see [Professional Development Funds]

## The Fishbowl

Graduate students have access to a common space in Crown Center 418, better known as the *Fishbowl*.
This is your space for studying, meetings, lunch, and socializing; however, the department is responsible for its security.
You may use the room up to the start of evening classes (7 p.m.).
After that, you must vacate the room and lock the door.

## Communications

If your home address or phone number change, inform the Administrative Assistant to the Graduate Program and update your records through [LOCUS].

An email account is created for each new student.
Students must check Loyola email regularly, read the messages sent them, and respond promptly to messages that require response.

Each graduate student is assigned a mailbox in the Department workroom in Crown Center.
Mailboxes should be checked regularly.

## Health Insurance

Graduate students enrolled for 8 or more credit hours or Thesis or Dissertation Supervision must have health insurance.
Details and instructions for enrollment are maintained at the [Bursar's Office webpage on Health Insurance](https://www.luc.edu/bursar/insurance.shtml).

Ph.D. students funded by assistantships will receive additional details in their annual "award letters," sent by the Graduate School.
Ph.D. students who are enrolled in fewer than eight credits in the fall semester must contact the [Graduate School Awards and Budget Manager](#the-graduate-school) if they wish to be enrolled in Loyola's health insurance plan.

## Housing

Most graduate students find off-campus apartments using the ads in publicly available sources.
Residence Life provides a list of [suggested resources for locating housing](https://www.luc.edu/reslife/futureresidents/graduatestudents/).

## Transportation

See the [Campus Transportation website](https://www.luc.edu/campustransportation/index.shtml) for information on parking, the inter-campus shuttle, and 8-RIDE.
Public buses and the "El" run frequently between campuses and to other points in the city.
See the [Chicago Transit Authority website](https://www.transitchicago.com/).

## Your Tech Stack

Be deliberate about your choice of tools and methods for academic research and writing.
Cultivate a sense of curiosity regarding the technical details of your own scholarly practice (search and discovery, reference management, file management, reading, annotation, note-taking, drafting, revision, fact-checking, proofreading, etc.) and ask your peers and professors about their ways of working.
Do not assume that the particular set of tools and practices which you learned as an undergraduate, or earlier, will suffice for your present and future endeavors.

## Professional Development Funds

Professional development funds are available from the Graduate School and EGSA.
For details on funds administered by the Graduate School, see the Graduate School's page on [Research](https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics/research/), under "Conference Travel Awards."
The current subvention from the Graduate School for travel is a maximum of \$750.
For funds administered by EGSA, contact the EGSA treasurer.

Both sources of funding are distributed as expense reimbursement.
Students seeking reimbursement must supply original receipts, boarding passes, and proof of attendance (conference registration receipt and a program copy showing your session).
Ask the Graduate Program Assistant for the travel expense form, fill it out, and return it with the receipts to the Graduate School (for their funding) or to EGSA treasurer (for EGSA funding).

## Placement Officer

The placement officer advises students on all aspects of the academic job search and arranges mock interviews and mock job talks.
All students who are entering the academic job market should contact the placement officer in the semester before they begin to apply for positions.

The department has two collections of advice and information for students entering the job market:

- [The Academic Job Search](https://www.luc.edu/english/graduate/resourcesandpolicies/theacademicjobsearch/)
- [A Sakai site](https://sakai.luc.edu/portal/site/cbbe1aa5-2045-4182-ac93-c26499a0fa0a)

Contact the placement officer for access to the Sakai site.

## The Loyola Literacy Center

Since 1992, the Loyola University Literacy Center has provided free tutoring to adult learners of English, many of whom are Rogers Park residents.
The Literacy Center is directed by Dr. Jacqueline Heckman and staffed by Loyola students.
English graduate students are warmly invited to participate.
For more information see the [Literacy Center website](https://www.luc.edu/literacy/) or contact Dr. Heckman.

## Clayes Essay Awards

Each year the Department sponsors a competition among graduate students for the Stanley Clayes Memorial Award.
Cash prizes are awarded to essays written for 400-level graduate seminars in the preceding academic year.
The call for papers comes out at the beginning of fall term.
For details see the [Stanley Clayes Essay Competition Submission Guidelines].

# Regulations and Procedures

Students should read the [Graduate School Academic Policies].
The Department of English maintains additional policies, detailed in this Handbook and elsewhere.
In cases of conflict between this Handbook and a policy of the Graduate School, the Graduate School policy shall prevail.

## Advising

The GPD serves as faculty advisor for all M.A. students and for Ph.D. students prior to [Advancement to Candidacy].
Students meet individually with the GPD prior to [Registration] each semester.
Students are encouraged to confer with the GPD at other times and must do so when contemplating [Withdrawal](#withdrawal-from-courses) from a course or another significant change in their studies.
See also the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Academic Advising."

Ph.D. students applying for faculty jobs are advised by the [Placement Officer].

## Course Loads

See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under the section "Enrollment in Courses," subsection "Student Enrollment Status."
Full-time students enroll in three courses per semester.[^exceptions]
Course loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual basis.
All students funded by the Graduate School must maintain full-time status.

[^exceptions]: For exceptions to the 'three-course' rule see [ENGL 502], [ENGL 610 and 600], and [Ph.D. Milestones and Normative Timeline].

Ph.D. students with government loans that mandate year-round registration may register for GSSM S61 (if they are in 610) or S60 (for 600) over the summer.
Students register themselves for these courses and pay a nominal fee.

## Registration

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing their dissertations.
A schedule of courses for the upcoming term is available a few months before classes are scheduled to begin.

To register for graduate courses you must first consult with the Graduate Programs Director: see [Advising].
Once your selections are approved, they will be entered into the system by the Administrative Assistant to the program, completing the registration process.
Graduate students do *not* register for courses themselves, but you must check [LOCUS] to verify your registration each semester.

Students must maintain continual registration throughout their years in the program or risk having to apply for reinstatement and pay both a penalty and back fees.

## Grades

For letter grades and their associated grade-point values, see the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Grades."

Graduate students must maintain a grade average of not less than *B* (3.00).
Students whose grade-point average falls below 3.00 are placed on academic probation.
See [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Probation and Dismissal."

No more than two courses for which a student receives a final grade of *C+* or *C*, and no course for which a student receives a final grade of less than a *C*, may be applied toward the fulfillment of degree requirements.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Computation of Academic Grade Point Averages."

Ph.D. students should also see the section [Minimum GPA for Ph.D. Students](#minimum-gpa).

## Withdrawal from Courses

Withdrawal from graduate seminars is uncommon; students must consult with the Graduate Program Director before dropping through [LOCUS].
Students should check the academic calendar for deadlines on withdrawing for full or partial refunds, and with a W or F grade.
For additional details and policies, see the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Grades."
Students are responsible for withdrawing themselves from classes.

## Incompletes

The Graduate School maintains policies on incompletes, including time limits for completion of work: see the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Grades."
The Department of English has two additional policies:

- Students who seek an incomplete should inform the GPD of their intention, by email.
- No more than one incomplete should be requested per semester, unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., a serious illness).

Ordinarily an incomplete is granted to accommodate illness or other misfortune suffered by a student at the end of a semester.
Students who request an incomplete should provide their professor and the GPD with a plan that specifies the work to be completed and a timeline for completion of it.
A professor who approves a requested incomplete may, at the time of approval, amend the student's proposed plan.
Any plan *should* include work missed due to an unexpected adverse life event at the end of the semester; a plan *may* include earlier work, but there is no expectation that *all* missing work be submittable under the terms of an incomplete.
Submittable work, if completed successfully, should be sufficient to provide a passing grade.
The work-plan agreed by the professor should be communicated to the GPD.

M.A. students who take two or more incompletes in any given semester should consider applying for a [leave of absence](#leaves-of-absence).
In such cases, a leave of absence allows a student to complete unfinished work and rest adequately before taking on additional academic obligations.

## Leaves of Absence

Official leaves of absence are intended for students who wish to discontinue temporarily their graduate studies due to special circumstances (e.g., medical, personal, or professional reasons).
For details and policies, see the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Leaves of Absence."
Students who wish to request a leave of absence should first speak with the Graduate Programs Director.

## Parental Leave

For parental leave see the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Parental Leave Policy".

## Transfer Credit and Advanced Standing

It is ordinarily expected that all work for the Master's degree will be completed at Loyola.
Upon the recommendation of the GPD, however, and with the approval of the Dean, up to six hours of credit for graduate work at another university may be counted toward the M.A. degree.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Transfer Credit."

For students entering the Ph.D. program with prior graduate work, up to thirty hours of credit may, with the Department's recommendation and the Dean's approval, be counted toward a Loyola Ph.D.
The precise number of hours credited toward advanced standing is worked out by the GPD during a student's first year in the program.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Advanced Standing Toward the Doctoral Degree."

## Academic Integrity

The Department of English abides by the policies on academic integrity set forth in the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Academic Integrity Policy and Processes."
Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests primarily as plagiarism, defined by the Graduate School as "the use of ideas, language, or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material is not one's own."
Students who have questions about this policy should consult the GPD or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the assignment, which may well be tantamount to failure in the course.
A serious breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola.
Although extremely rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have resulted in dismissal.

## Appeals Procedures

The Graduate School maintains policies that allow students to appeal a course grade, a finding of academic misconduct, or another adverse academic decision.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Academic Appeals," "Academic Appeal of Course Grade," "Academic Appeal of Non-Coursework Evaluation of Research and Scholarship," "Academic Integrity Policy and Processes," and "Appeal for Change of Academic Record."

## Time Limits for Completion of Degree Requirements {#time-limits}

The Graduate School maintains time limits for completion of M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, as follows:

- M.A. students must complete all degree requirements within **five years** of beginning the first course at Loyola University Chicago taken as a degree-seeking M.A. student.
- Ph.D. students who completed a relevant M.A. degree (or a significant amount of relevant graduate coursework) at another institution prior to entering the doctoral program must complete all Ph.D. requirements, including the dissertation, within **six years** of beginning the first course at Loyola University Chicago applicable toward the doctoral degree.
- Other Ph.D. students must complete all degree requirements, including the dissertation, within **eight years** of beginning the first course at Loyola University Chicago applicable toward the doctoral degree.

Time limits may be extended only with the permission of the Graduate School.
Extensions are not routine; students must demonstrate progress toward the degree.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Time Limit for Completion of Degree Requirements" and the subsection "Extension of Time Limits."

Ph.D. students should see the [Ph.D. Milestones and Normative Timeline].

## Graduation and Application for Degree

Loyola confers degrees three times each year: May, August, and December.
A student graduates when they have completed all degree requirements and submitted an application for the degree.
Applications for degree are due approximately six months before degree conferral: typically December 1 for a May degree, February 1 for an August degree, and August 1 for a December degree.
These dates are set by the Graduate School: see the list of [Key Dates and Deadlines].
Applications for degree are submitted through [LOCUS].
Late applications are not accepted: students who miss a deadline must apply for a subsequent graduation date.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Degree Conferral/Graduation."

As students "walk" only at the May graduation, August and December degree students may walk in the May ceremony the following year.

# The Master of Arts Program

Students in the M.A. program complete course requirements and a qualifying exam.
A full-time student can complete these requirements in a year and a half of study --- Fall, Spring, one summer course, and the following Fall with a degree conferral in December.
The authoritative statement of program requirements is the university's [Academic Catalog](https://catalog.luc.edu/graduate-professional/graduate-school/arts-sciences/english/english-ma/#curriculumtext).

For policies and instructions on the M.A. Exam, see the Academic Catalogue and [Instructions for the M.A. Exam](#ma-exam-full-instructions), below.

# The Doctor of Philosophy Program

## Program Requirements

Ph.D. students complete general course requirements and course requirements of their specialization, pass a Ph.D. qualifying exam, and meet other program requirements, as detailed in the following sections and in the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum].
See also the [Ph.D. Milestones and Normative Timeline].
In cases of conflict the Academic Catalog is authoritative.

### Course Requirements

For course requirements, including field-specific requirements, see the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum].

#### Minimum GPA

Students who fall below a grade-point average of 3.00 are placed on academic probation.
See [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Probation and Dismissal".

The Department of English has a more stringent policy for first-year Ph.D. students, as follows.
First-year Ph.D. students whose GPA for the fall and spring semesters is below 3.50 must submit a portfolio of three essays (totaling at least 30 pages) to the GPD the week after spring semester final exams.
The portfolio must contain a letter to the GPD explaining the challenges the student faced the first year and how the student has responded to those challenges.
Members of the Graduate Programs Committee review the portfolio and make a recommendation to the GPD, regarding the student's continuation in the Ph.D. program.

#### ENGL 502

ENGL 502 ("Independent Study for Doctoral Qualification") is the capstone of the course requirements for the Ph.D. and serves as preparation for the [Ph.D. Qualifying Examination].
This course is a 'full-time equivalent'.
Except in special circumstances, it is taken in the semester after completing the last of the 400-level course requirements.

The director of ENGL 502 must be identified in the semester before a student enrolls in this course.
This is done in consultation with the GPD, who must approve the [Departmental Form for ENGL 502](https://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/english/docsamppdfs/gradresources/engl502.pdf).
Usually the faculty director of ENGL 502 will also serve as director of the student's dissertation.

The student and their faculty director should meet for a minimum of 7 hours, approximately 1 hour every two weeks.
Early in the semester, the faculty director and student should agree on outcomes for the course.
These should include field lists for the Ph.D. Qualifying Exam, as approved lists are due in the semester before the exam is taken: see the [Instructions for the Ph.D. Qualifying Exam](#phd-exam-full-instructions).
Other written components of ENGL 502 are set by the faculty director, but usually include drafts of field statements and may include a literature review or a draft of the dissertation proposal.

### ENGL 610 and 600

After ENGL 502 students proceed to ENGL 610 ("Doctoral Study").
After two semesters in ENGL 610, students are registered in ENGL 600 ("Dissertation Supervision").
Students must maintain continuous registration in ENGL 600 until they complete their degree.
Both 610 and 600 require a minimum of one contact hour monthly with the dissertation director.
A student who successfully defends their dissertation before the end of the second week of the fall or spring semester is not required to register for ENGL 600 in that final semester.

For expectations in ENGL 610 and 600 see [Post-coursework Progress] and the [Ph.D. Milestones and Normative Timeline].

### Ph.D. Qualifying Examination {#phd-exam}

For basic information about the Ph.D. qualifying examination, see the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum], under "PhD Qualifying Examination."
Full instructions are supplied in the [Appendix](#phd-exam-full-instructions).

### Research Tool

See the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum], under "Research Tool."

#### Summer Language Courses

Students who plan to fulfill the research tool requirement by taking a translation exam may prepare for that by enrolling in a basic reading course in a supported language.
Courses in French, German, Latin, and Spanish for reading are offered by Marquette University and St. Louis University in on-line modality during summer sessions.[^marquette-slu-details]
Comparable courses may be available at Loyola: check the course catalog or ask the GPD.
All these courses are specially designed for graduate students in humanities disciplines.
The teaching objective is literacy for research purposes.
To fulfill the research tool requirement, students should contact the GPD after completion of the course.
The GPD will arrange an exam.

[^marquette-slu-details]: At Marquette University the relevant course numbers are FREN 6204, GRMN 6204, and LATN 6204.
At St. Louis Univeristy the relevant course numbers are SPAN 5010 and FREN 5010.
To enroll in a course run by Marquette University, complete Marquette's [Exchange Application](https://graduate.admissions.marquette.edu/register/mu-exchange).

Students in the Medieval and Renaissance Studies track should watch for announcements from the Newberry Library's [Center for Renaissance Studies](https://www.newberry.org/research/research-centers/renaissance-studies) (CRS), which runs courses and workshops on research tools needed by specialists in these fields.
For funding queries, contact Loyola's [Faculty Representative](https://www.newberry.org/research/research-centers/renaissance-studies/consortium) to the CRS Consortium.

#### Guidelines for Language Exams

The format and ground rules of language exams are set by examiners and should be communicated to students in advance.
The Graduate Programs Committee has made the following general recommendations:
exams are usually one hour in length, handwritten, with the aid of a bilingual dictionary.

The skill tested is translation into English.
Some exams consist of a single passage for translation, others of two passages, with or without choice.

Grades are "Pass" and "Fail".
The standard is usually comprehension, not an unerring performance in rendering of grammar and idiom.
On account of variation in linguistic difficulty within and between languages, we make no recommendations regarding the number of errors allowed.
The examiner's decision as final.

Students who fail the exam may take another exam in the same language at a later date.
In such cases, the GPD will usually transmit advice from the examiner to the student, regarding the kind of study recommended.


### Responsible Conduct of Research

See the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum], under "Responsible Conduct of Research."
Ph.D. students should complete this requirement in year three or four.
Workshops are offered several times each year.
Details are posted on the [RCRS webpage](https://www.luc.edu/ors/RCRHome.shtml).

### Post-coursework Progress

The Graduate Programs Committee has established the following expectations for progress in [ENGL 610 and 600]:

- ENGL 610, first semester: pass the PhD qualifying exam
- ENGL 610, second semester: file an approved dissertation prospectus
- ENGL 600, first semester: complete one chapter; or conduct preparatory reading and research
- ENGL 600, subsequent semesters: complete one chapter per semester

For additional details see the [Ph.D. Milestones and Normative Timeline].

Dissertation directors submit grades (P/NP) for their advisees at the end of each semester of ENGL 610 and 600.
A single missed target is often excusable by extenuating circumstances.
A second consecutive semester of missed targets may be grounds for an "NP" grade.
A grade of "NP" places a student on academic probation, a status that is lifted when the student completes expected work.
See [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Probation and Dismissal".

Students with registered disability accommodations are exempt from this policy.
For such students, appropriate progress is determined on a case by case basis.


### Advancement to Candidacy

Students advance to doctoral candidacy when they fulfill all course requirements and the [Research Tool Requirement](#research-tool), pass the [Ph.D. Qualifying Examination](#phd-exam), identify a dissertation director, establish a dissertation committee, and produce an approved dissertation proposal.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Doctoral Candidacy".
Dissertation committees comprise a director and two or three faculty readers.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Dissertations and Theses," subsection "Committees".

The Graduate Program Director advises in the selection of a dissertation committee.
Approval of the dissertation committee and dissertation proposal is done in [GSPS].

### Dissertation Defense and Submission

A public oral defense is required of all dissertations.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Text and Oral Defense".
Preparations for the defense begin when members of the committee have approved all chapters.
The process is then as follows:

1. The candidate makes a "Format Check Submission": see [Dissertation/Thesis Formatting](https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics/dissertationandthesis/).
1. The candidate supplies members of the dissertation committee with format-checked reader's copies of the dissertation.
Reader's copies must be provided to the committee not less than one month prior to the defense.
Each reader also receives a ballot at this time: see [Department Links and Forms].
1. Committee members return their voted ballots to the GPD.
Ballots must be received at least one week prior to the defense date.
1. If the ballots are in favor of proceeding to defense, the defense date is confirmed and a public announcement is made.

The committee may require revisions of the dissertation up to and including the time of the defense.

The defense takes the form of a presentation by the candidate (approximately 30 minutes), followed by a question-and-answer period led by the committee.
After the question-and-answer period, the committee withdraws to deliberate.
The committee's decision is recorded on a Graduate School dissertation ballot.
See the Graduate School's [downloadable forms](https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics/forms/).
This ballot should be downloaded and printed by the candidate prior to the defense: provide a paper copy to your dissertation director on the day of the defense.

After the defense, the candidate makes any remaining corrections and revisions required by the committee.
Candidates then submit to the Graduate School a final, approved electronic copy of the dissertation.
See the [Graduate School Academic Policies], under "Dissertations and Theses" and "Final Copies of the Text", with additional links.
Deadlines for these steps are maintained in the Graduate School's calendar of [Key Dates and Deadlines].

## Independent Study

ENGL 501 ("Directed Readings") is an elective "independent study" course which may be taken at most twice in the Ph.D. program.
Students interested in this option must first find a faculty member willing to direct the independent study.
There is a departmental form (see [Department Links and Forms]) which must be submitted to the GPD for approval in the semester prior to the course.
Proposals for 501 will not be approved if the material to be covered is regularly offered in existing graduate seminars.

501 requires a minimum of 12 contact hours between faculty and student (approximately 1 hour every week) and a minimum of 25 pages of writing.

## Optional Concentrations and Specializations

Ph.D. students may obtain a "concentration" in Women's Studies and Gender Studies (WSGS) or a "specialization" in Digital Humanities (DH).
Both credentials are obtained through coursework.
For details on the concentration in WSGS, see the page [Concentration in WSGS for PhD Students](https://www.luc.edu/wsgs/academics/concentrationinwsgsforphdstudents/).
For details on the specialization in DH, see the Academic Catalog [Description of the English PhD Curriculum], under "Optional Specialization in Digital Humanities."

## Funding

### Assistantships

Ph.D. students are typically funded for five years by assistantships, the terms of which are set by the Graduate School: see the Graduate School webpage on [Financial Assistance and Funding], under "Assistantships."

Ph.D. students on assistantships have a sequence of assignments, one per semester, designed to support their development as teachers and researchers.
The following is the normal sequence:

- *First year, both semesters*: Writing coach in the Writing Center (two shifts per week)
- *Second year, fall semester*: Teaching assistant in a composition course
- *Second year, spring semester* and *third year, fall semester*: Primary instructor in a composition course
- *Third year, spring semester*: Teaching assistant in a literature course
- *Fourth and fifth years*: Primary instructor in a literature or composition course; Associate Director of the Writing Center; or teaching or research assistant to a member of the graduate faculty

All students serve as primary instructor for at least two composition courses and two literature courses during the period of their assistantship.
The Department Chair makes all assignments in consultation with the GPD.
The appendices to this handbook supply [Guidelines for Teaching Assistants](#guidelines-teaching-assistants)
and [Guidelines for Research Assistants](#guidelines-for-research-assistants).

### Funding beyond the fifth year

Students who have completed the term of their Assistantship and advanced to candidacy are eligible to apply for three fellowships:

- Arthur J. Schmitt Leadership Scholars Fellowship
- Teaching Scholars Fellowship
- Crown Fellowship

For details see the Graduate School's page on [Financial Assistance and Funding](http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/FundingGrad.Education.shtml), under "Fellowships & Scholarships."
Students are not eligible to receive the same fellowship twice.

Another source of post-fifth-year funding is the Dissertation Formatting Assistantship.
Details will be supplied when this position becomes available.

Summer or academic-term teaching may be available to advanced Ph.D. students unfunded by an Assistantship or Fellowship.
Contact the Department Chair or Office Coordinator for information.
