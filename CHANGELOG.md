# Changelog

This Changelog documents substantive changes to the text of the Graduate Student Handbook.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), but the scope is limited to textual content, ignoring repository utilities.
The intended reader is a student or member of the faculty who wants to understand changes in program policy.

Versions are designated with the format YEAR.SUFFIX, where YEAR is the four-digit Academic Year (i.e., "2026" for the academic year spanning 2025--6) and SUFFIX is a zero-indexed numeral, usually an integer.
Minor fixes are sometimes designated with decimals.
