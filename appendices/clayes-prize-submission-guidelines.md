Every year the Department of English sponsors a competition among graduate students for the Stanley Clayes Memorial Award. Prizes will be awarded to outstanding papers written in a graduate course in English in the previous academic year, including both summer terms.

Each student may submit only one essay to the competition. Students who have won first or second place prizes in the past are ineligible to compete again. Students who have received honorable mention may compete one more time. Essays should be revised versions of papers submitted for graduate course work. Only papers written for 400â€‘level courses are eligible. (Papers written for 501 or 502 will not be considered.)

Submissions are read by faculty members of the Graduate Programs Committee, who select winners and determine the prizes. The amount awarded varies from year to year depending upon the income generated by the gift of Professor Clayes' estate and the discretion of the Graduate Programs Committee. Names of the winners are announced approximately one week before the annual Clayes reception. Winning papers are presented at the Clayes reception, hosted by the EGSA.

The deadline for submissions and the date of the Clayes reception are announced at the beginning of each academic year.

Essays should be carefully proofread, anonymized, and between 10 and 25 pages in length.
Your name must not appear anywhere in the essay or its file name.
In a separate document (the "cover page") supply the following:

- your name
- the title of the essay
- the number, title, and semester of the course in which you first wrote the essay

Essays and cover pages should be submitted via email attachment as PDF documents (not word processing files).
Submissions should be sent to the Graduate Program Assistant or Office Manager, as specified in the annual competition announcement.
Use the subject line "Submission for the Clayes Memorial Essay Competition".

File names should be derived from the title of your essay.
The file name of the cover page should be formatted as `cover-page-TITLE-OF-YOUR-ESSAY.pdf`.
