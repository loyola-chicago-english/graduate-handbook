The Graduate Programs Committee has formulated the following general guidelines for Teaching Assistantship work.

1. TAs and faculty mentors should meet soon after they receive their assignments.
In this initial meeting, which may be virtual, the TA and faculty mentor should review these guidelines and jointly work out any modifications, specifications, or additions to them.
The outcome of this meeting should be reported to the GPD, by email.
The simplest form of this message would read, "We have reviewed the guidelines for TAs and agree to them without modification."

1. TAs and their mentors should meet at least every other week to discuss the class and pedagogy in general.

1. TAs are expected to give eighteen hours per week on average to the course in which they serve and no more than twenty hours in any one week.
The time commitment includes attending class, holding office hours, grading papers, and preparing lessons.

1. TAs should attend every class session throughout the semester.
This obligation counts toward the weekly time commitment.

1. Office hours for TAs should amount to no more than two hours per week, except in the weeks before graded assignments are due.

1. TAs should either teach the equivalent of one week of classes during the semester *or* lead one weekly discussion section.
A mentor should attend and provide feedback on at least one of the TA's classes.

1. If the TA is to lead a regular (weekly) discussion section, the mentor should make clear prior to the beginning of the semester the parameters of the student's responsibilities for that section.
Those responsibilities may include the regular grading of papers and exams for the TA's section, which should be done under the supervision of the mentor, especially early in the semester.

1. If the TA is working within a section taught by a faculty member, TA and mentor should meet prior to the beginning of the semester to review the syllabus and agree on the classes that the TA will lead, based upon the needs and preferences of both parties.
In this case, the introduction of the TA into the grading of student writing should be gradual.
TAs should first read and, on separate paper, comment on one set of papers or a portion thereof and discuss the grades and comments with the mentor.
Later in the semester, the TA should comment on and grade one complete set of papers, which the mentor should review before returning them to the class.
Alternatively, the TA might comment on and grade a portion of each set of essays (e.g., a third of each of three sets of papers).
The mentor should provide the TA with sample graded papers of various grade ranges prior to the TA grading papers on their own.

1. Mentors should not ask TAs for assistance with their research.

1. At the end of the semester, mentors should prepare written evaluations of the TA assigned to them.
Evaluations are sent to the GPD for the student's file.
