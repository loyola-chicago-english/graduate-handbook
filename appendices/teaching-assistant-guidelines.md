The Department of English has formulated the following general guidelines for Teaching Assistants and their faculty mentors.
These guidelines apply to TA assignments in both the Writing Programs and the literature curriculum.

1. TAs and faculty mentors should meet prior to the beginning of the semester to discuss expectations and the course syllabus.
In this initial meeting the TA and faculty mentor should review these guidelines and jointly work out any modifications.
The outcome of this meeting should be reported to the GPD, by email.
The simplest form of this message would read, "We have reviewed the guidelines for TAs and agree to them without modification."

1. The faculty mentor should introduce students to the TA in the first week of classes; the role of the TA should be explained to students.

1. TAs and faculty mentors should meet at least every other week to discuss the class and teaching in general.

1. TAs are expected to give eighteen hours per week on average to the course in which they serve and no more than twenty hours in any one week.
The time commitment includes attending class, holding office hours, grading papers, and preparing lessons.

1. TAs should attend every class session throughout the semester.
This obligation counts toward the weekly time commitment.

1. Office hours for TAs should amount to no more than two hours per week, except in the weeks before graded assignments are due.

1. TAs should teach two or three lessons during the semester.
These may be full class periods or a portion thereof.
Lessons may be on assigned readings, aspects of formal academic writing, or another topic appropriate to the class.
Dates and topics for lessons should be agreed at the beginning of the semester, based on the needs and preferences of both parties.
Lesson plans should be discussed in advance.
The faculty mentor should attend the TA's lessons and provide feedback to the TA.

1. The TA should perform some portion of the grading, usually equivalent one full set of papers.
Introduction into grading should be gradual and supported.
For example, the TA might first read and mark a portion of one set of papers, then discuss grades and comments with the faculty mentor.
Later in the semester, the TA may grade one complete set of papers, which the faculty mentor should review before returning to students.
Alternatively, the TA might comment on and grade a portion of each set of papers (e.g., a quarter of each of four assignments).
The faculty mentor should provide the TA with sample graded papers of various grade ranges before the TA grades papers on their own.

1. TAs for composition courses should conference with students, either with or without the faculty mentor, either in class or outside of class.
As with grading, TAs might do all the conferencing for one paper or meet with a few students for each of the main assignments.

1. Faculty mentors should not ask TAs for assistance with their research.

1. At the end of the semester, faculty mentors should prepare written evaluations of the TA assigned to them.
Evaluations are sent to the GPD for the student's file.
In the semester following, when the assistant is teaching their own course, the faculty mentor and assistant should meet at least once to discuss teaching.
The faculty mentor should also attend at least one of the assistant's classes, write a short report on that visit, and send it to the GPD.
Reports on composition courses should be sent to the Writing Programs Director (WPD) also.
If the faculty mentor is not able to observe the assistant's teaching, they should contact the GPD or WPD, who will make alternative arrangements.

Matters concerning assignment of sections or other administrative decisions should be referred to the Department Chair;
matters concerning the assistant's performance should be referred to the GPD;
matters concerning the Writing Programs should be referred to the WPD.
