title: Normative timeline and milstones for the Ph.D.
---

The table below shows two paths through the Ph.D. program.
The path labeled "MA+PhD" shows milestones for students who have no prior graduate coursework in English.
The path labeled "PhD" shows milestones for students who hold an M.A. in English and apply 30 credit hours (the maximum possible) toward fulfillment of the coursework requirement for the Ph.D.
See [Advanced Standing](#transfer-credit-and-advanced-standing).
Students with some prior graduate coursework, but fewer than 30 hours, will follow a path intermediate between the two shown here.

The timeline runs to six years because Loyola-sourced funding is usually not available beyond the sixth year.
The statutory time limit for completion of the Ph.D. is longer: see [Time Limits](#time-limit-phd).

Notes:

1. Students admitted without an M.A. take the M.A. exam after completing ten 400-level courses
1. Students enroll in three 400-level courses per semester unless teaching their own course, in which case they enroll in two
1. All students teach UCWR 110 in the spring of their second year
1. Students may enroll in up to two courses each summer; summers may also be used to meet the [Research Tool Requirement](#research-tool), work ahead, or prepare conference presentations or publications
1. Students should enroll in ENGL 502 as their sole course in the semester after finishing all 400-level course requirements; it is usually not advisable to enroll in 502 during the summer, due to reduced faculty availability
1. The Ph.D. qualifying exam is usually taken in the semester after 502; the dissertation proposal follows that. See [ENGL 610 and 600](#engl-610-and-600).
1. The writing process usually involves cycles of feedback from advisors, not reflected in the timelines above
1. Students funded by assitantiships must apply for jobs and/or fellowships in the fall of their fifth year
<!--
1. Current students run at least one year behind this schedule in the post-coursework phase
