Assistantships are governed by policies maintained by the Graduate School and the Department of English.
The relevant Graduate School policies are collected in the [Graduate Assistant Handbook](https://www.luc.edu/gradschool/studentexperience/graduateassistanthandbook/).

The Graduate Programs Committee has formulated the following general guidelines for Research Assistantship work.

1. RAs and faculty mentors should meet soon after they receive their assignments.
In this initial meeting, which may be virtual, the RA and faculty mentor should review these guidelines and jointly work out any modifications, specifications, or additions to them.
The outcome of this meeting should be reported to the GPD, by email.
The simplest form of this message would read, "We have reviewed the guidelines for RAs and agree to them without modification."

1. RAs are expected to give eighteen hours per week on average to the research project and no more than twenty hours in any one week.
The time commitment includes all forms of work on the research project.

1. RAs and the faculty members should meet to discuss the research project and research practices in general (e.g., research tools, protocols, ethics) at least three times during the semester. This can be done virtually.

1. Faculty members should not ask RAs for assistance with their teaching.

1. At the end of the semester, the RA should prepare a written report on research accomplished and skills acquired, and the faculty member should prepare written evaluations of the RA's work.
Both should be returned to the GPD for inclusion in students' files.
